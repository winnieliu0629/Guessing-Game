## What are we trying to make?
 We are going to build an interactive guessing game website. The game itself is very straightforward: The user guesses a number between 1-100. The app should respond and indicate if their guess is 'hot' or 'cold' based on how close the guess is to the number they are trying to guess. The game should also keep track of previous guesses. For some extra features, the app could also provide the user with a way to reset the game or get a hint.

 The styling for this project is completely up to you! This is an opportunity to get creative with CSS, while also flexing your new DOM manipulation skills.
